1. Communications services : Core network

This suggests that the "Communication services" component is primarily responsible for the core networking functionalities of the National Information Network. The core network is the central part of a telecommunication network that provides various services to customers connected by the access network. It's the backbone that interconnects different parts of the network, ensuring data transmission between them.

The core network would handle the primary data routing and manage the main communication pathways. It would be responsible for ensuring efficient data transmission, handling network traffic, and maintaining connectivity across the entire network infrastructure.

2. Data center hosting services : Aggregation networks

The component "Data center hosting services" provides the infrastructure for storing and managing critical data and applications. The associated "Aggregation networks" ensure that traffic from various sources within the data center is efficiently consolidated and managed before it interacts with the core network.

3. Naming and branding services : Access networks

The association between "Naming and branding services" and "Access networks" suggests that there's a focus on ensuring that the entry points to the network (i.e., the access networks) are clearly identifiable, labeled, and possibly customized for users. This could be to ensure easy accessibility, trustworthiness, or to promote specific national platforms and services.

4. Message and information exchange services : Internal traffic exchange centers

Connecting the two, the association between "Message and information exchange services" and "Internal traffic exchange centers" implies that the National Information Network places a significant emphasis on ensuring that domestic data exchange (like emails, messages, and other forms of communication) is efficiently managed and optimized. By routing this data through internal exchange centers, the network can ensure faster, more reliable communication while also retaining more control over the data, which can be crucial for reasons ranging from national security to data sovereignty.

5. Public and dedicated cloud services : International traffic exchange centers

the association between "Public and dedicated cloud services" and "International traffic exchange centers" suggests a strategic positioning of cloud services in relation to international data exchange. It implies that the network is equipped to handle cloud data that interacts with international entities, whether it's data being stored in international cloud environments or domestic cloud data being accessed by international users. This setup can be crucial for businesses and services that operate on a global scale, ensuring that they can efficiently and reliably access cloud resources regardless of where the data originates or is destined.

6. Infrastructural cloud services : Content distribution networks

The association between "Infrastructural cloud services" and "Content distribution networks" suggests an integrated approach to delivering digital content. By combining the scalability and flexibility of cloud infrastructure with the efficiency of CDNs, the network can ensure that content, whether hosted on domestic cloud servers or elsewhere, is delivered to users quickly and reliably. This setup can be particularly beneficial for services that experience fluctuating demand, as they can scale their resources up or down as needed while still ensuring optimal content delivery to their users.
