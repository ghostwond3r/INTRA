1. Communications services : Core network

This suggests that the "Communication services" component is primarily responsible for the core networking functionalities of the National Information Network. The core network is the central part of a telecommunication network that provides various services to customers connected by the access network. It's the backbone that interconnects different parts of the network, ensuring data transmission between them.

The core network would handle the primary data routing and manage the main communication pathways. It would be responsible for ensuring efficient data transmission, handling network traffic, and maintaining connectivity across the entire network infrastructure.

2. Data center hosting services : Aggregation networks

The component "Data center hosting services" provides the infrastructure for storing and managing critical data and applications. The associated "Aggregation networks" ensure that traffic from various sources within the data center is efficiently consolidated and managed before it interacts with the core network.

3.Content and application services : Access networks

The "Content and application services" component ensures that users have access to the digital content and applications they need. The associated "Access networks" ensure that individual users or devices can connect to the network to access these services. Together, they represent the interface between the end-user and the vast array of digital services available on the network.
