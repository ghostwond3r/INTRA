1. Communications services : Core network

This suggests that the "Communication services" component is primarily responsible for the core networking functionalities of the National Information Network. The core network is the central part of a telecommunication network that provides various services to customers connected by the access network. It's the backbone that interconnects different parts of the network, ensuring data transmission between them.

The core network would handle the primary data routing and manage the main communication pathways. It would be responsible for ensuring efficient data transmission, handling network traffic, and maintaining connectivity across the entire network infrastructure.

2. Data center hosting services : Aggregation networks

The component "Data center hosting services" provides the infrastructure for storing and managing critical data and applications. The associated "Aggregation networks" ensure that traffic from various sources within the data center is efficiently consolidated and managed before it interacts with the core network.

3. Naming and branding services : Access networks

The association between "Naming and branding services" and "Access networks" suggests that there's a focus on ensuring that the entry points to the network (i.e., the access networks) are clearly identifiable, labeled, and possibly customized for users. This could be to ensure easy accessibility, trustworthiness, or to promote specific national platforms and services.

4. Message and information exchange services : Internal traffic exchange centers

Connecting the two, the association between "Message and information exchange services" and "Internal traffic exchange centers" implies that the National Information Network places a significant emphasis on ensuring that domestic data exchange (like emails, messages, and other forms of communication) is efficiently managed and optimized. By routing this data through internal exchange centers, the network can ensure faster, more reliable communication while also retaining more control over the data, which can be crucial for reasons ranging from national security to data sovereignty.

5. E-commerce services : Transaction networks

The "E-commerce services" component represents the various platforms and systems that facilitate online commerce. The associated "Transaction networks" ensure that all financial transactions on these platforms are handled securely and efficiently, providing both merchants and customers with confidence in the online shopping experience.

6. E-government services : Government networks

the "E-government services" component represents the suite of digital services provided by the government to its citizens and other stakeholders. The associated "Government networks" ensure that these services are delivered securely, reliably, and efficiently, meeting the high standards expected of government operations.
